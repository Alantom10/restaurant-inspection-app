RecyclerView is used for the restaurant list and inspection list, so that only a small amount of memory is required to set up the UI screen regardless of the number of restaurants or inspections.

Long pressing the Map View icon in the toolbar reveals its title. In landscape orientation, icons and their tiles will both be visible.
